Note on Backward paper:
Alg: Input: M, initialization of eig-vector
Output: eig-vector of M

Backward: Analytical formula of Power Iteration with ground-truth initialization,
proven to be accurate in limit and is bounded above.

For symmetric positive definite matrix, SVD and Eigen-decomp coincide.
For symmetric matrix, SVD and Eigen-decomp coincide up to sign(+-1)
