Push changes to remote Github repo:
1. Save change in local file.
2. git add [file.py]
3. git commit -m "say something"
4. git push tt_relu master 

Note on Backward paper:
Alg: Input: M, initialization of eig-vector
Output: eig-vector of M

Backward: Analytical formula of Power Iteration with ground-truth initialization,
proven to be accurate in limit and is bounded above.

For symmetric positive definite matrix, SVD and Eigen-decomp coincide.
For symmetric matrix, singular vector/values and Eigen-vector/value coincide up to sign(+-1)

structured high dimensional tensor can be directly decompose in TT format
